    "Body fat percentage can be defined as mass of fat divided by total mass. Body fat percentage is a very important index for people to evaluate their health condition, health costs and even happiness. Though it's important, it's not easy to compute as it's impossible to get mass of fat. Folks(1956) came up an idea to estimate body fat based on body density, density of lean body tissue and density of fat tissue, which do made computation possible. Katch and McArdle (1977) and Wilmore (1976) gave an good estimation of density of lean body tissue and density of fat tissue. The only problem left is how to estimate body density, which is costly to get precise estimation.Thus, it would be great if we can come up with either a new way to estimate body fat percentage or an economical way to estimate body density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our group built two models that can estimate body fat percentage fairly accurate with very limited body information. The first model we bulit estimates body fat percentage directly with abdomen circumference and weight. The second one estimates the reciprocal of body density to estimate body fat percentage with abdomen circumference and height"

    "More and more people focus on their health, and one of the ways to assess health is estimating percentage of body fat.  For a long time, people used various methods to estimate the percentage of body fat. Some people use predictive equations for body fat using body circumference measurements and skin-fold measurements. For example, the \"Siri's equation\" is\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentage of Body Fat = 495/density - 450\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is difficult for doctors to determine body volume (body density) by underwater submersion. We should find a way to determine percentage of body fat by commonly available measurements.  The dataset BodyFat.csv contains 252 records of  available measurements: age, weight, height, adiposity, neck circumference, chest circumference, abdomen circumference, hip circumference, thigh circumference, knee circumference, ankle circumference, biceps circumference, forearm circumference and wrist circumference. Also, we have density determined from underwater weighing and percentage of body fat from Siri's (1956) equation. We should use the data to construct simple and robust statistical model to predict percentage of body fat."

And the one which perfroms best using two variables is taking weight and abdomen as predictors. The R square has been improved by about 0.06. However, as weight is a commonly used measurement that almost everyone knew their weight, adding weight as a predictor is good way to improve the accuracy of our model.
